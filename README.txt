This repository contains various image processing applications that I have
written in Python 3

im1.py - contains median filter and adapative filter application for
         grayscale and RGB images


im2.py - contains grayscale and RGB image segmentation applications.
	 This includes basic thresholding algorithm and k-means algorithm,
	 both in using 3 dims (i.e. r, g, b axes) and 5 dims
	 (i.e. r, g, b, i, j axes).

im3.py - contains histogram applications for grayscale intensities, to output
	 equalized histogram images.

image_kernels.py - contains various image kernels that can be applied to
	 grayscale images
